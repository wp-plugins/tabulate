This plugin provides a simple user-friendly interface to tables in the database.
Somewhat akin to phpMyAdmin, but including only data-modification features.

Features (in no particular order):

1. Access can be granted to *read*, *create*, *update*, *delete*, and *import*
   records in any or all tables. (This can be done by anyone with the
   *promote_users* capability.)
2. CSV data can be imported, with the UI supporting column mapping, data
   validation, and previewing prior to final import.
3. A quick-jump navigation box (located top right of every page) can be
   activated by installing the [WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/)
   plugin.
4. Records in tables with *date* columns can be viewed in a calendar.

## Installation

Follow the usual plugin installation procedure.

To get a quick-jump navigation box, also install the
[WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) plugin.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How should issues be reported?

Please log all bugs, feature requests, and other issues in the GitHub issue
tracker: https://github.com/tabulate/tabulate/issues

### What modifications does Tabulate make to the database?

None. Some [options](http://codex.wordpress.org/Option_Reference) are created,
all prefixed with `tabulate_`. These store the granted permissions (one per
Tabulate grant; i.e. five so far).

## Screenshots

1. The main screen of a single table, with provision for searching and navigating.
2. The permission-granting interface. All roles are shown across the top, and
   all tables down the left side.

## Changelog

A full list of changes can be found at
https://github.com/tabulate/tabulate/commits/master

Prior to version 1, changes are not being lsited here (there are too many of
them, and nothing is stable yet).

## Upgrade Notice

No special action needs to be taken to upgrade. Tabulate can be deactivated and
reactivated without losing any data; if uninstalled, it will remove everything
that it's added (but you'll be warned of this, don't worry).
